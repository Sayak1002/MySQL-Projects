Welcome to my SQL Projects Repository! This repository showcases a collection of SQL projects that Iâ€™ve worked on to demonstrate my skills in database management, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis. Below, you will find brief descriptions of the three projects included in this repository, each of which is housed in its respective folder.
